Grant
Chipotle Double Meat Player of the week! If Luck and Kelvin are back, Grant's going to be tough as hell to beat. Not to mention his bench almost outscored Pony too. 
Jen
Newcomer putting up the second highest point total of the week! Let's see how far the Double De's can keep it bouncing.
Rajeev
Strong showing from the newcomer, but come on man? A team name that doesn't include your player? Tsk tsk.
Kerry
Started from the bottom (last year) and off to a great start this year. Can she stay purrrrfect after week 2??
Jeremy
Deangelo = pretty safe the first 4 weeks, but what about after?
Ron
The lowest scoring winner this week. Will Dak to Dez survive?
Matt
Team logo != Team name. You deserve to lose despite your high points
Kin
Last year's champ had some struggles with AP and left a lot of points on the bench
Ben
John Brown let him down big time in the Fitz vs Brown matchup. Can he bounce back?
Ed
Had one player who laid a goose egg. Lol.
Tony
Got hit the hardest with injuries, but doesn't change the fact that he's still the Del Taco Player of the week. So much for Coby Beef.
Richard
Nothing looks great about this team right now
