Kerry
Can confirm, Brady is still back. We're still fucked.
Jen
Shady cannot be stopped. If Hopkins can return to last year's form, she can easily take that #1 spot 
Jeremy
Is this the real Jamaal or will things still trend upward after Ware's huge game?
Rajeev
Finally gathered a loss despite a huge day from Miller. That's what you get for having a team name based on a player someone else owns.
Matt
Narrow win but survived thanks to Gronk. Will he continue with his first rounder finally back?
Ben
Took down an undefeated overrated Roger. This team is fucking scary since Bell came back.
Grant
Such a shame seeing David Johnson's potential going to waste. You should just trade him.
Tony
Not often we have the Chipotle Double Meat Player of the Week face the Del Taco of the week. What a day! Let's see if this wildly inconsistent team can gather any momentum.
Ed
Got fucked by Brady. And Foster. And Ingram. And Marshall. And Crabtree. And Maclin. And Wilson.

Also at 1-5 and now Brown is without Big Ben. Langford and Dez are still out. Is it time to blow it up?
Richard
Did respectable without his best player. At 1-5, another loss probably means playoff elimination soon.
