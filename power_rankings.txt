Jen
Top 2 occupied by the females in the league! Strong showing by her stars. If Blount keeps it up, it's going to be hard for anyone to stop her.
Kerry
Sacko last year continuing with a great performance. Who needs RBs anyways?
Jeremy
No Jamaal no problem
Grant
Toppled over by the huge Double De's. Luck went back to his 2015 self.
Rajeev
Sitting hot with tons of great WRs. Solid all around.
Matt
Dat bench. Dat Gronk. spooky.
Kin
A strong roster puts Kin at this spot despite starting 0-2. Can he survive despite AP's and Woodhead's injuries? Dat Fuller though.
Ron
Looks like Fat Lacy is staying fat.
Ed
Will Brandon Marshall survive? And Foster?
Ben
Lost to his twin. Can he survive until Bell comes back?
Richard
Gurley. Rawls. Cobb. All 3 with consecutive bad weeks. Ouch.
Tony
lol
