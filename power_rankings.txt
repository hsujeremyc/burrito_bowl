Current points scored leader! Blount is easily making up for how shitty Nuk is doing.
Kerry
Trailing Jen by only 1 point in total points for the season! The battle of the ovaries rages on.

Still not a believer since he just played Kin, the giver of burritos.

Playoffs within reach, but lol at Alshon. Good luck brah.

Macaroni hair gave him a clutch win to still keep him in the playoff race!
Richard
Cutler.
Ron
He took Prosise. Fuck.
