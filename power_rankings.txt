Jen
Unstoppable. And holy shit Jen vs Kerry this week GET HYPE
Jeremy
Jameis returns! Despite terrible showings from Julio, Decker, and Deangelo, still pulled out a solid week. Need dat Jamaal though...
Kerry
Killing it per usual. If Freeman is back, this team's scary
Rajeev
So lucky with Hyde, Sanders, and Marvin Jones producing monster days. Marvin seems like the real deal though
Matt
Did well but lol at the Jets and 6 interceptions
Grant
Goose egg from Kelvin. Terrible performances from everyone except 2 players. What started so promising is now coming to a sudden hault
Tony
Holy Shit. Christine Michael hype train full steam!!
Ron
Antonio Brown just isn't enough. And now with Langford, Moncrief hurting, Ron's looking at a potential freefall
Ed
The Marshall and Foster injuries could really hurt. Is Tavon Austin for real though?
Kin
Clever team name and logo couldn't save him here. Only one player scored double digits. Yikes. Dat Jordan Howard stash though
Richard
Just unlucky here, should have been able to pull off the win but Cobb keeps hurting him. If he read Reddit, he probably would have started Parker over Cobb and gotten the win though :p
Ben
lol holy shit. Too bad we weren't ESPN last year, but this might be the lowest point total of our league's short history. Bell is back, but is it too little too late?
