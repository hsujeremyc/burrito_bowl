Kerry
Good luck Ron. You're fucked.
Jen
All girls burrito bowl looking imminent.
Ben
Chipotle Double Meat Player of the Week...WITHOUT Le'Veon Bell. Holy fuck.
Matt
Squeaked out a narrow win against Rajeev and has quietly solidified his position amongst the tops. Return of Gronk and the emergence of Gio were huge. Oh, and also my dumbass for telling him to pick up Jacquizz sigh
Rajeev
For once, you lose a close game. Marvin Jones's hot start seems to have finally faded.
Jeremy
fuck.
Grant
Solid showing from everyone and is one game behind from the top 6! Let's see if his waiver wire wonders can keep rolling.
Tony
No OBJ, no win. Likely a must win this week vs Grant if he wants any shot at making the playoffs still.
Richard
Bent over by Kerry, nothing new here.
Ed
Del Taco...Ingram with -1.5 points lol.
Ron
6 game losing streak snapped! Big whoop.
Kin
Technically, not mathematically eliminated from the playoffs yet...but who are we kidding lol.
