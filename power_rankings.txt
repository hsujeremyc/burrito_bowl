Jen
Might be a surprise taking back the #1 spot, but this team is just too good. No Shady? No problem (but please no Shady vs me).
Kerry
Still staying undefeated despite a sub 100 point performance. But that was without Third Leg Greg.
Jeremy
Despite having Antonio Brown AND Julio now, team will be undergoing some growing pains, especially in this week 8 BYE of death. Also Jamaal ;__;
Rajeev
Big week, but got hit with an unlucky loss for once. Dat Dalton to Green connection is starting to look oh so sweet though.
Matt
Has worked his way back up very suddenly and is now #3 in points scored in the league.
Grant
Back to back 200+ yard games from Ayaji. Holy fuck.
Ben
Potential pickup of the year in Ty Montgomery now that he's a RB and a WR. Though this team is already stacked at RB.
Tony
After dominating last week, the volatility of his team showed. Dat bench though...
Ed
Close loss despite the low output. Can he truly continue leaning on a sorry ass WR like Crabtree, or is his sorry ass QB to blame.
Richard
Kin: "Apparently, I bring out the best in everyone in fantasy. Except Jen." Enjoy your burrito, because I'm sure you're going to be shit again next week.

Ron
Has quietly lost SIX in a row. Was the first blockbuster trade too little, too late?
