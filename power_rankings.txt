JULIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jen
Jesus Demarco is scary. Hopkins needs some help, though he may not get it at Minny
Kerry
Came up with a huge win in the battle of the ladies. Fozzy coming in the clutch big time, but can she sustain with him and Eli being so subpar?
Rajeev
This fairweather fan keeps getting lucky and barely squeaking away wins, but wins are wins. Let's see if things will continue.
Grant
Jordan Reed finally exploded with everyone else doing their fair share.
Matt
Really needs Gronk to contend and climb the ranks.
Tony
Brutal loss. Let's see if baby tempered macaroni hair man will save your season.
Ed
Crabtree so gud. Ingram looking good.
Ron
Derek Henry and Orleans Darkwa are your starting RBs? lol good luck bro.
Ben
Finally got a W now that Bell is back. Though I hope you end up missing the playoffs due to the total points tiebreaker for benching the Vikings D.
Kin
Damn, just can't catch a break. Who would have thought Gostkowski would get -1. Can Kin and Richard overcome 0-4?
Richard
lol wtf 60.7 points. Was going to say something about being unlucky but you're dead last in total points too. Last year's #2 looking like shit.
